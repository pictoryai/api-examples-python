# Text to Video Generation

Pictory's Text-to-Video APIs offer a dynamic way to transform the text into engaging videos.

These APIs allow for the creation and editing of videos based on various text inputs. For instance, if you have a blog or an article, you can easily convert it into a captivating video by simply providing the webpage URL. Text-to-Video APIs open up various possibilities, including:

1. Generating new videos directly from existing text content.
2. Converting your published blogs or articles into videos using their URLs.
